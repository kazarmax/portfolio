    "## Iterating in Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use `.iterrows()` to iterate over rows\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Iterate over pit_df and print each row\n",
    "for i,row in pit_df.iterrows():\n",
    "    print(row)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Use one variable instead of two to store the result of .iterrows()\n",
    "for row_tuple in pit_df.iterrows():\n",
    "    print(row_tuple)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use `.itertuples()` to iterate over tuples\n",
    "`.itertuples()` returns each DataFrame row as a special data type called a namedtuple. You can look up an attribute within a namedtuple with a special syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Loop over the DataFrame and print each row\n",
    "for row in rangers_df.itertuples():\n",
    "  print(row)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For each row in Pandas dataframe, it return structure like:\n",
    "`Pandas(Index=0, Team='TEX', League='AL', Year=2012, RS=808, RA=707, W=93, G=162, Playoffs=1)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Loop over the DataFrame and print each row's Index, Year and Wins (W)\n",
    "for row in rangers_df.itertuples():\n",
    "  i = row.Index\n",
    "  year = row.Year\n",
    "  wins = row.W\n",
    "  print(i, year, wins)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use pandas .apply() method\n",
    "\n",
    "As `map()` method allows to use the specified funtion to all values in iterable, `apply()` allows to use the function to the dataframe accessing df either by rows (`axis = 1`) or by columns (`axis = 0`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Gather sum of all columns in dataframe\n",
    "stat_totals = df.apply(sum, axis=0)\n",
    "print(stat_totals)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Gather total runs scored in all games per year\n",
    "total_runs_scored = rays_df[['RS', 'RA']].apply(sum, axis=1)\n",
    "print(total_runs_scored)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 3:\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Create a win percentage Series \n",
    "win_percs = dbacks_df.apply(lambda row: calc_win_perc(row['W'], row['G']), axis=1)\n",
    "print(win_percs, '\\n')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use pandas .values() method\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is built on top of numpy.\n",
    "When we use `df['column'].values()`, it has type of np.array. That means we can apply broadcasting feature here, that is very efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "`baseball_df['RS'].values() - baseball_df['RA'].values()`\n",
