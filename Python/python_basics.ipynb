    "### Lambda functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda functions in Python are small, anonymous functions that are defined without a name using the `lambda` keyword. \n",
    "Lambdas are useful when you need a quick function to do some work for you.\n",
    "If you plan on creating a function you'll use over and over, you're better off using `def` and giving that function a name.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Anonymous Functions**: Lambda functions are anonymous because they don't require a name declaration. They are defined inline where they are needed and can be used as expressions within larger code blocks.\n",
    "- **Concise Syntax**: Lambda functions have a compact syntax, allowing you to define them in a single line. They consist of the lambda keyword, followed by the arguments (parameters), a colon (:), and the expression to be evaluated.\n",
    "- **Single Expression**: Lambda functions can only contain a single expression, which is evaluated and returned as the result. They are not suitable for complex logic or multi-line code blocks.\n",
    "- **No Statements**: Unlike regular functions defined with def, lambda functions can't include statements such as if, for, or while. They are limited to a single expression.\n",
    "- **Function Objects**: Lambda functions return function objects that can be assigned to variables or passed as arguments to other functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When to Use Lambda Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda functions are useful in the following scenarios:\n",
    "- As arguments to higher-order functions.\n",
    "- For short, simple operations that don't require complex logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pros of Lambda Functions\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods to Work with Files\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Opening a File \n",
    "To open a file, you can use the built-in `open()` function, which takes the file path and the mode as parameters. The mode can be `\"r\"` for reading, `\"w\"` for writing, `\"a\"` for appending, and more.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**`read()` Method**:\n",
    "- The `read()` method reads the entire content of a file and returns it as a single string.\n",
    "- It reads from the current position of the file pointer until the end of the file.\n",

    "- The returned string includes newline characters (`\\n`) representing line breaks in the file.\n",

    "- The `readline()` method reads a single line from the file and returns it as a string.\n",
    "- It reads from the current position of the file pointer until it encounters a newline character (`\\n`) or reaches the end of the line.\n",
    "- Each time you call `readline()`, it moves the file pointer to the next line.\n",
    "- If the file pointer is already at the end of the file, it returns an empty string.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`readlines()` Method**:\n",
    "- The `readlines()` method reads all lines from the file and returns them as a list of strings.\n",
    "- It reads from the current position of the file pointer until the end of the file.\n",
    "- Each line in the list includes the newline character (`\\n`) at the end, except for the last line.\n",
    "- You can iterate over the returned list to access each line individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the `read()` method returns the entire file content as a single string, the `readline()` method reads one line at a time, and the `readlines()` method returns all lines as a list of strings. \n",
    "The choice between them depends on your specific needs. \n",
    "- Use `read()` when you want the entire content as a single string\n",
    "- Use `readline()` when you want to read lines one by one\n",

    "##### Reading the Entire File\n",
    "In this example, the `read()` method is used to read the entire content of the file named `\"example.txt\"`. The content is stored in the `content` variable and then printed.\n",

    "content = file.read()\n",

    "    for line in file:\n",

    "my_file = open(\"text.txt\", \"r\")\n",

    "## Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, classes provide a way to define new types or objects with their own attributes (variables) and methods (functions). They serve as blueprints for creating objects with specific characteristics and behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A class is a user-defined data type that encapsulates data and methods into a single entity.\n",
    "- It allows you to define a blueprint or template for creating objects that share similar properties and behaviors.\n",
    "- Objects created from a class are called instances or objects of that class.\n",
    "- Classes provide encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, which are fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating class\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax:\n",
    "```\n",
    "class ClassName(object):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, parameter1, parameter2, ...):\n",
    "        # Constructor method\n",
    "        # Initialize instance variables\n",
    "\n",
    "    def method1(self, parameter1, parameter2, ...):\n",
    "        # Method definition\n",
    "\n",
    "    def method2(self, parameter1, parameter2, ...):\n",
    "        # Method definition\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Additional methods and attributes\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here:\n",
    "- The `class` keyword is used to define a new class.\n",
    "- `ClassName` is the name of the class. It follows the same naming conventions as variables. By convention, user-defined Python class names start with a capital letter.\n",
    "- Parentheses after the ClassName are used to specify class to inherit from, that is to have all the properties from that class. In the example above, we inherit our class from `object`  class,  which is the simplest, most basic class. \n",
    "- The `__init__()` method is a special method known as the *constructor*. It is called automatically when an object is created from the class. You can use this method to initialize the instance variables (attributes) of the object. \n",
    "   - `__init__()` always takes at least one argument, `self`, that refers to the object being created and allows access to its attributes and methods.\n",
    "- The other methods defined within the class are regular methods that can perform various operations and computations. They are typically used to define the behavior of the objects created from the class.\n",
    "- Additional methods and attributes can be added as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can access attributes of our objects using dot notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `pass` placeholder\n",
    "\n",
    "`pass` doesn't do anything, but it's useful as a placeholder in areas of your code where Python expects an expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating an instance of class\n",
    "By creating instances of a class, you can work with specific objects that have their own unique characteristics and behaviors defined by the class blueprint.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax:\n",

    "new_object = ClassName(constructor_arguments)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- `variable_name`: Choose a name for the variable that will refer to the instance of the class.\n",
